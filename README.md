# Loan-prediction-using-Machine-Learning-and-Python
Aim:
 
 The main aim of this project is to predict the loan eligibility of a person.
 To predict the loan data by using some machine learning algorithms they are logistic regression,Decision Tree,RandomForest.
 
Attributes in the dataset:

Loan id, Gender, Married, Dependents, Education, Self Employed, Applicant income, Coapplicant income, Loan Amount,Credit History, Property_Area, Loan_Status.

Methodology:

Data requirements: It is a very vital role of a data analyst to check for the requirements of the data. What actually they need and what not?
Data collection: Collecting data is also a important part of the same as we need structred data and with minimal amount of anomolies.
Data understanding: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is done on the given data to see for the features that are most important and also check for errors.
Data preparation: After cleaning process we prepare the data for model development.
Model Development: In this vary stage we undergo the use of different machine learning algorithm to check which algorithm best fits the model and which does not.
Evaluation: After model development we check the performance metrics and do validation and also checks for the accuracy which produces more accurate results.
